# Description
I want to make my own lawn fertilizer by purchasing bulk nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium from an argriculture supplier. In order to do this I have to figure out how to scale the bulk components N-P-K ratios to the 4-1-2 ratio my lawn needs. This will ultimating end up as a script for easy tuning and formulation.

# Components ratios
## Nitrogen
My supplier has 45-0-0
## Phosphorus
My supplier has 0-20-0
## Potassium
My supplier has 0-0-60

If I were to mix these components one-to-one as is I would get a 45-20-60 or 2.25-1-3 ratio. *Note: these are the same ratios but different concentrations this will effect coverage (more on that later). **N-P-K is percent per weight!***

# Coverage
Coverage is usually described as pounds-of-nitrogen per 1,000 ft<sup>2</sup>.

At the time of writing this I believe my target coverage is .9 lbs per 1,000 ft<sup>2</sup>.

Given this coverage I can calulate the coresponding P and K coverages.
  P should be 1/4 of .9 or .9/4 = .225 lbs per 1,000 ft<sup>2</sup>
  K should be 1/2 of .9 or .9/2 = .45 lbs per 1,000 ft<sup>2</sup>
